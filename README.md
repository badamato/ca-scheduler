# Booking Application

## [Live Demo](http://www.gearshakedown.net/)

This project was built using Reactjs and Redux.  Clone the repo, change into the project folder, run `NPM INSTALL` to install the build packages, then `NPM START` to start the UI on localhost:3000.

Displaying a list of hour-long slots from 9am to 5pm, when one slot is clicked a modal form pops up which asks the user to enter their name and phone number.  When their name and phone number have been submitted, the time slot selected will change to red indicating it is no longer available.  Clicking on the red time slot again, the modal will pop up with the name and phone number for that appointment pre-populated.  Users can edit their information to change the appointment.
